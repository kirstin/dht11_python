# dht11_python
Read out the dht11 sensor using python only - without Adafruit library.

To use this script connect your dht11 sensor to the PI.  
Connect the data cable to GPIO pin 4 (pin 7).

Simply run the script using:

     python read.py
     
     
This script was tested on the RaspberryPi 3. Older versions of the PI might be unable to get sensible data with this script.
